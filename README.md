# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

## Objective of this exercise
Create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Methods used
### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

## Technologies
* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
